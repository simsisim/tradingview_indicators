[b]═══ PRIMARY IMPROVEMENT: NQUSB Hierarchical Index Benchmarks ═══[/b]

[b]The KEY improvement:[/b] Multi-Level Industry Granularity with Drill-Down/Drill-Up Navigation

[b]From:[/b] Simple ETF Comparison (1 Level)
Stock → Industry ETF (e.g., "SOXX" for all semiconductors)

[b]To:[/b] NQUSB Hierarchical Comparison (4 Levels)
[list]
[*] [b]Level 4 (Primary):[/b] NQUSB10102010 → Semiconductors (most specific)
[*] [b]Level 3 (Secondary):[/b] NQUSB101020 → Technology Hardware and Equipment
[*] [b]Level 2 (Tertiary):[/b] NQUSB101010 → Software and Computer Services
[*] [b]Level 1 (Quaternary):[/b] NQUSB10 → Technology (broadest sector)
[/list]

[b]Users can now drill up and down the industry hierarchy[/b] to see how their stock performs against different levels of industry classification!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[b]═══ WHY THIS MATTERS ═══[/b]

[b]Original Limitations:[/b]
[list]
[*] Single comparison level - ETF only
[*] No drill-down capability - Can't zoom in to more specific industries
[*] No drill-up capability - Can't zoom out to broader sectors
[*] ETF limitations - Not all industries have dedicated ETFs
[*] Arbitrary mappings - Manual ETF selection may not represent true industry
[/list]

[b]Improved Capabilities:[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]4-level hierarchical navigation[/b] - Drill-down and drill-up through industry classifications
[*] [b]361 NQUSB official indices[/b] - NASDAQ US Benchmark Index structure
[*] [b]Official NASDAQ classification[/b] - Industry-standard taxonomy
[*] [b]Large Mid Cap (LM) option[/b] - Focus on larger companies when needed
[*] [b]Enhanced UI[/b] - Clear level indicators and full index descriptions
[/list]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[b]═══ EXAMPLE: ANALYZING NVDA (Semiconductors) ═══[/b]

[b]Level 4 - Primary (Most Specific):[/b]
NQUSB10102010 - Semiconductors
→ NVDA vs. AMD, AVGO, QCOM, TXN, etc. (direct competitors)

[b]Level 3 - Secondary (Broader):[/b]
NQUSB101020 - Tech Hardware & Equipment
→ NVDA vs. AAPL, CSCO + semiconductors

[b]Level 2 - Tertiary (Even Broader):[/b]
NQUSB101010 - Software and Computer Services
→ NVDA vs. all tech hardware

[b]Level 1 - Quaternary (Broadest):[/b]
NQUSB10 - Technology Sector
→ NVDA vs. entire technology sector

[b]You can now zoom in to see direct competitors or zoom out to understand macro sector trends - all in one indicator![/b]

[b]═══ COMPARISON SUMMARY ═══[/b]

[b]Original Version:[/b]
[list]
[*] Comparison System: Industry ETFs
[*] Industry Levels: 1 (flat ETF mapping)
[*] Total Classifications: ~140 industries
[*] Hierarchy Navigation: ❌ No
[*] Data Source: Manual ETF curation
[/list]

[b]Improved Version:[/b]
[list]
[*] Comparison System: NQUSB Official Indices
[*] Industry Levels: [b]4 (hierarchical drill-down/up)[/b]
[*] Total Classifications: [b]361 NQUSB indices[/b]
[*] Hierarchy Navigation: ✅ [b]4-level drill navigation[/b]
[*] Data Source: [b]NASDAQ official taxonomy[/b]
[*] Large/Mid Cap Option: ✅ [b]LM variant toggle[/b]
[*] Level Indicator: ✅ [b][Index-L1] to [Index-L4] labels[/b]
[/list]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[b]═══ REAL-WORLD USE CASES ═══[/b]

[b]For Day Traders:[/b]
[list]
[*] Start with Primary (L4) → See how stock compares to direct competitors
[*] If sector is weak overall → Drill up to Tertiary (L2) to see if all tech is down
[/list]

[b]For Swing Traders:[/b]
[list]
[*] Monitor at Secondary (L3) → Track stock vs broader industry group
[*] Identify divergences → Outperformance at L4 but underperformance at L2 signals sector rotation
[/list]

[b]For Position Traders/Investors:[/b]
[list]
[*] Analyze all 4 levels → Understand if stock strength is industry-specific or sector-wide
[*] Sector rotation signals → Outperformance at L1 (sector) but underperformance at L4 (industry) = consider sector ETFs
[/list]

[b]For Sector Rotation Strategies:[/b]
[list]
[*] Compare L1 (Quaternary) across different stocks → Identify strongest/weakest sectors
[*] Drill down to L4 → Find best stocks within winning sectors
[/list]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[b]═══ ADDITIONAL FEATURES ═══[/b]

[list]
[*] [b]Dual Comparison System[/b] - Toggle between ETF mode (original) and Index Benchmark mode (NQUSB hierarchy)
[*] [b]Better Fallback Logic[/b] - Manual Override > NQUSB Index > ETF > SPY default
[*] [b]Enhanced Display[/b] - 4-row information table with full NQUSB index description
[*] [b]Backward Compatible[/b] - All original ETF mappings still work, existing charts won't break
[*] [b]Large Mid Cap Toggle[/b] - Optional "LM" suffix for focusing on larger companies only
[/list]

[b]The result:[/b] More accurate, more flexible, and more comprehensive industry strength analysis - enabling traders to understand exactly where their stock's performance comes from by drilling through multiple levels of industry classification.
