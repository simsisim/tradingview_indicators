[b]═══ WHAT'S NEW ═══[/b]
[b]4-Level Hierarchical Navigation:[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Primary:[/b] All 11 NQUSB sectors (NQUSB10, NQUSB15, NQUSB20, etc.)
[*] [b]Secondary (Default):[/b] Broad sectors like Technology, Energy
[*] [b]Tertiary:[/b] Industry groups within sectors
[*] [b]Quaternary:[/b] Individual stocks within industries (37 semiconductors)
[/list]
[b]Enhanced Stock Coverage:[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]1,176 total stocks[/b] across 129 industries
[*] [b]37 semiconductor stocks[/b]
[*] Market-cap weighted selection: 60% tech / 35% others
[*] Range: 1-37 stocks per industry
[/list]

[b]═══ CORE FEATURES ═══[/b]
[b]1. Drill-Down/Drill-Up Navigation[/b]
View NVDA at different granularity levels:
[list]
[*] [b]Quaternary:[/b] ● NVDA ranks #3 of 37 semiconductors
[*] [b]Tertiary:[/b] ✓ Semiconductors at 85% (strongest in tech hardware)
[*] [b]Secondary:[/b] ✓ Tech Hardware at 82% (stronger than software)
[*] [b]Primary:[/b] ✓ Technology at 78% (#1 sector overall)
[/list]
[b]Insight:[/b] One indicator, one stock, four perspectives - instantly see if strength is stock-specific, industry-specific, or sector-wide.

[b]2. Visual Current Stock Identification[/b]
[b]Violet Markers - Instant Recognition:[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]●[/b] (dot) marker when current stock is in [b]top N performers[/b]
[*] [b]✕[/b] (cross) marker when current stock is [b]below top N[/b]
[*] Violet color (#9C27B0) on both symbol and value labels
[*] Example: "NVDA ● ranks #3 of 37"
[/list]

[b]3. Rank Display in Title[/b]
Dynamic title shows performance context:
[list]
[*] "Semiconductors (RS Rating - 3 Months) | NVDA ranks #3 of 37"
[*] #1 = Best performer, higher number = lower rank
[*] Total adjusts if current stock auto-added
[/list]

[b]4. Auto-Add Current Stock[/b]
[b]Always Included:[/b]
[list]
[*] Current stock automatically added if not in predefined list
[*] Example: Viewing PRSO → "PRSO ranks #37 of 39 ✕"
[*] Works for any stock - from NVDA to obscure small-caps
[*] Violet markers ensure visibility even when ranked low
[/list]

[b]═══ DUAL PERFORMANCE METRICS ═══[/b]
[b]RS Rating (Relative Strength):[/b]
[list]
[*] Normalized strength score 1-99
[*] Compare stocks across different price ranges
[*] Default benchmark: SPX
[/list]
[b]% Return:[/b]
[list]
[*] Simple percentage price change
[*] Direct performance comparison
[/list]
[b]11 Time Periods:[/b]
1 Week, 2 Weeks, 1 Month, 2 Months, [b]3 Months (Default)[/b], 6 Months, 1 Year, YTD, MTD, QTD, Custom (1-500 days)
[b]Result: 22 analytical combinations[/b] (2 metrics × 11 periods)

[b]═══ USE CASES ═══[/b]
[b]Sector Rotation Analysis:[/b]
[list]
[*] Is NVDA's strength semiconductors-specific or tech-wide?
[*] Drill through all 4 levels to find answer
[*] Identify which industry groups are leading/lagging
[/list]
[b]Finding Hidden Gems:[/b]
[list]
[*] JPM ranks #3 of 13 in Major Banks
