 What the config does:                                                                                                              
                                                                                
  1. Filter: (PV Breakout Flag == 1) and (Gap1 Size % > 0)                                                                           
    - Only shows PV breakouts that have a positive gap                                                                               
    - Filtered from 741 → 103 stocks
  2. Multi-Level Sort:
    - Primary: PV Days Ago (ascending) → Most recent first (0 = today)
    - Secondary: Gap1 Size % (descending) → Biggest gaps first
  3. Result: Top 20 shows:
    - All have PV Days Ago = 0.0 (today's breakouts!)
    - Sorted by gap size: 19.67% down to 8.91%
    - Only 1 chart generated (no bottom chart)

  Config Breakdown:

  # Multi-column sorting
  SORT_COLUMNS = ['PV Days Ago', 'Gap1 Size %']
  SORT_ASCENDING = [True, False]        # First asc, second desc

  # Filter for PV breakouts with positive gaps
  FILTER_EXPRESSION = "(`PV Breakout Flag` == 1) and (`Gap1 Size %` > 0)"

  # Only show top results
  SHOW_BOTTOM = False

  # Chart shows gap sizes
  CHART_METRIC = 'Gap1 Size %'

  Other Scenarios You Can Create:

  Scenario 2: Oldest PV Breakouts (still active)
  SORT_COLUMNS = ['PV Days Ago']
  SORT_ASCENDING = [False]
  SHOW_BOTTOM = False

  Scenario 3: Highest Combined Scores
  SORT_COLUMNS = ['Combined Score']
  SORT_ASCENDING = [False]
  SHOW_BOTTOM = True  # Show both top and bottom

  Scenario 4: Recent Gaps Only (no PV filter)
  SORT_COLUMNS = ['Gap1 Days Ago', 'Gap1 Size %']
  SORT_ASCENDING = [True, False]
  FILTER_EXPRESSION = "`Gap1 Flag` == 1"
