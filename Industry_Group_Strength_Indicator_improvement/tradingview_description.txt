[b]═══ PRIMARY IMPROVEMENT: Smart Stock Selection (V5) ═══[/b]

[b]38 Pre-selected Stocks[/b] - Top industry leaders by market capitalization
[b]+1 Current Stock[/b] - Always includes the stock you're analyzing
[b]+1 Index Request[/b] - For RS Rating calculation (when selected)
[b]= 40 Total[/b] - Perfectly optimized for TradingView's request limit

[b]Visual Enhancements:[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Violet Markers[/b] - Current stock shows ● when in top performers, ✕ when below
[*] [b]Rank Display[/b] - Title shows "TICKER ranks #X of Y" (e.g., "PRSO ranks #37 of 39")
[*] [b]Example:[/b] Viewing PRSO (not in predefined 38) auto-adds it as 39th, displays violet ✕ marker
[/list]

[b]Why This Matters:[/b]
[list]
[*] Market-cap weighted relevance - Only the most significant companies
[*] Always includes your stock - No matter what you're viewing
[*] Instant visual identification - Violet markers on both labels
[*] Know your rank immediately - #1 = best, higher = worse
[*] Industry leaders focus - Most representative of sector trends
[*] No micro-cap noise - Eliminates distortion from small stocks
[*] Maximizes TradingView limits - Uses all 40 allowed requests
[*] Systematic & reproducible - Objective selection criteria
[/list]
